# Read input integers separated by space, then split them and convert to integers
numbers = map(int, input().split())

# Calculate the sum of the numbers
total_sum = sum(numbers)

# Output the total sum
print(total_sum)


# this is better because it is faster, and can apply to more cases not only just 2 int as input
